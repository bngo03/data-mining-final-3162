## Overview

This project presents a data-driven evaluation of mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs), aimed at identifying investment vehicles that provide superior risk-adjusted returns. By combining financial theory with machine learning techniques, we analyze over 24,000 funds using the **‚ÄúMutual Funds and ETFs‚Äù** dataset by Stefano Leone (Kaggle). Our analysis focuses on:

- Cost efficiency (e.g., expense ratios)
- Risk profiles (e.g., beta, Sharpe ratio)
- Performance consistency (e.g., 5-year and 10-year returns)
- Strategic management (active vs. passive)

Our objective is to support informed decision-making for both retail and institutional investors by offering intuitive visualizations and empirically grounded insights.

## Dataset Summary

**Source**: Kaggle ‚Äî [Mutual Funds and ETFs Dataset by Stefano Leone](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/stefanoleone992/mutual-funds-and-etfs)  
**Size**: 24.8 MB  
**Observations**: 24,239 funds  
**Features**: 27  

### Key Variables:
- **Fund Attributes**: Name, category, inception date, fund family, strategy (active/passive)
- **Performance Metrics**: Annual returns (1Y, 3Y, 5Y, 10Y), dividend yield, NAV
- **Risk Indicators**: Beta, alpha, standard deviation, Sharpe ratio, Morningstar rating
- **Cost Metrics**: Expense ratio, management and load fees
- **Operational Characteristics**: Turnover ratio, total net assets, minimum investment

## Methodology

We employed the following techniques to derive actionable insights:

### üìà Linear Regression
Used to assess the relationship between:
- Expense ratios and long-term returns
- Risk metrics (e.g., beta) and return variability

We specifically tested the hypothesis that passively managed ETFs with lower expense ratios outperform actively managed mutual funds on a risk-adjusted basis.

### ü§ñ K-Means Clustering
Funds were grouped based on:
- 5-year returns
- Expense ratios
- Sharpe ratios
- Total net assets

Clusters were assigned performance ratings (A+ to F) to facilitate fund comparison by peer group.

### üîç Comparative Analysis
Analyzed:
- Actively vs. passively managed strategies
- Top-performing funds within key asset classes (e.g., large-cap equity, bond)
- The impact of cost and turnover on returns

## Visual Analytics

The following visualizations support our analysis:

- **Risk vs. Return Scatter Plot** (Beta vs. 5-Year Return)
- **Bar Chart**: Average Expense Ratio by Fund Type
- **Histogram**: Distribution of 5-Year Returns
- **Box Plot**: Sharpe Ratios by Fund Category
- **Correlation Heatmap**: Key financial variables

All outputs are located in the `/visuals/` directory.

## Evaluation Plan

To validate our methodology and findings, we conducted a peer review with finance students and assessed:
- Clarity of visualizations and insights
- Usability of models for selecting funds by risk tolerance
- Effectiveness of grading via clustering

### Metrics:
- Regression performance: R¬≤, RMSE, p-values
- Clustering validation: Silhouette score
- Qualitative feedback from survey respondents
